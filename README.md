## How I started
  In this project, the first thing I did was start the skeleton of the HTML file. Adding the semantic elements such as a "header", "main", "footer".
  I continued to add onto this with "nav", and "section" elements.
  
  At this stage after adding the semantic elements, I began adding more information and trying to view the lines before I filled in the paint.
  
## Adding the CSS
  After adding the necessary HTML elements, I began by adding CSS backgrounds to each section, dividing up the space so I could get a better view of what I was working with.
  
  When I finished dividing the sections, I then began adding my flexboxes to each div class I needed to
  
## What I had struggled with
  During this project, I struggled with primarily the flexbox, as it wasn't working the way that I had intended it to.
  
  Just after breaking the code multiple times, it clicked in how I should work with flex box and their content
  
## What I would change
  If I had more time with this challenge, I would most likely scrap the CSS code and rework it. Overall try to get a better understanding in how the css functions work.
