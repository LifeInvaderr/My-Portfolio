## How I started
  In this project, the first thing I did was start the skeleton of the HTML file. Adding the semantic elements such as a "header", "main", "footer".
  I continued to add onto this with "nav", and "section" elements.
  
  At this stage after adding the semantic elements, I began adding more information and trying to view the lines before I filled in the paint.
  
## Adding the CSS
  After adding the necessary HTML elements, I began by adding CSS backgrounds to each section, dividing up the space so I could get a better view of what I was working with.
